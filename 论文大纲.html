triangles or planar polygons will be subdivided against a knot box, but it will produce pathological triangles which will contribute to many problem about efficiency and robustness. On the other hand, cui utilize the parallel computing power of the GPU via CUDA, which is limited to NVIDIA hardware. <br>
Thus, his method can not be used on neithor AMD GPU nor mobile platform. In this paper, we propose an approach which will be used to clip the original model to avoid pathological case. Moreover, we implement the whole framework of smooth FFD with OpenGL compute shader in order to make it more general. <br>
Our subdivision method will produce sub-triangles as regular as possible, but cannot guarantee that each sub-triangle lies in a knot box.Accordingly the method will introduce acceptable errors. However, the trade-off is worthwhile in accordance with Error analysis. We als0 extend the deformation framework to the mobile phone by the aid of the good across-platfor of OpenGL. </p><div class="md-section-divider"></div><h2 data-anchor-id="8xf4" id="介绍">介绍</h2><p data-anchor-id="6lmp">Free-form deformation (FFD) is a prevalent shape manipulation and shape animation method in computer graphics andgeometric modeling (Sederberg and Parry, 1986). Classic FFD is conducted on the sampled points of the geometric model.However, the approach tends to produce an aliased deformation result when using a low sampling density. <br>
As an alternative, smooth FFD (Cui et al., 2015) which is on the foundation of accurate FFD (Feng et al., 1998, 2002; Feng and Peng, 2000) deforms the planar polygons as a set of triangular Bézier patches based on the functional composition of Bernstein polynomials (DeRose, 1988; DeRose et al., 1993). The deformation result is smooth and sharp feature awareness. However, In the pre-processing phase, the pathological sub-triangles producted by clip process will worsen efficiency and robustness. So we propose another subdivision approach to get more regular sub-triangle with the cost of a little increase of error. On the other hand, the framework's applicability and generality are bad due to the limit of CUDA. In order to address it, We implement our compute-intensive task with OpenGL compute shader. <br>
The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:</p><ol data-anchor-id="727z">
<li>A new clip method are proposed to get more regular sub-triangles.</li>
<li>Implement the framework by OpenGL compute shader for better applicability and generality.</li>

The main concept of FFD is to embed the object into an intermediate space, e.g., a Bézier volume. Users first edit the shape of the intermediate space; then, the space deformation is transferred to the embedded object, whereas the topological connectivity of the object remains unchanged. There are many successive studies regarding FFD. Most of these studies focus on improving the interactive means of FFD (Coquillart, 1990; Hui, 2002; MacCracken and Joy, 1996; McDonnell et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2013). Gain and Bechmann (2008) provided a detailed survey of these methods.</p><p data-anchor-id="nvr5">Traditional FFD and its extensions deform the sampled vertices of the model. Thus, the quality of the deformation result depends on the sampling density of the vertex. As a solution to the sampling problem, adaptive upsampling approaches (Gain and Dodgson, 1999; Griessmair and Purgathofer, 1989; Parry, 1986) are more efficient than the naive uniform upsampling approach  on CPU. The adaptive upsampling approaches consider the polygon size or surface curvature and upsample the model if necessary. But they cannot handle certain special or pathological cases well, and are difficult to be ported on GPU. Accurate FFD, which was proposed by Feng et al. (1998, 2002), Feng and Peng (2000), is an alternative approach to solving the sampling problem. However, it is computationally intensive, and it also consumes considerable bandwidth, i.e., transferring a large amount of data from the CPU to the GPU after the intensive computations are performed in the CPU. Thus, the algorithms are not interactive or performed in real time in practical applications.</p><p data-anchor-id="3ol9">In the recent years, GPUs have been widely adopted for FFD implementations due to their tremendous parallel computing power. Chua and Neumann (2000) proposed an OpenGL-oriented hardware evaluator sub-system to accelerate FFD evaluations. However, none of the GPU vendors integrate this type of dedicated sub-system into their GPUs. In contrast, GPUs have evolved into general-purpose many-core processors. Schein and Elber (2006) implemented a GPU-accelerated FFD using the NVIDIA CG language. Jung et al. (2011) achieved the same goal using NVIDIA CUDA and embedded it to the X3D system. Hahmann et al. (2012) proposed a GPU-based, volume-preserving FFD. They employed the multilinear property of volume constraint and derived an explicit solution. The GPU acceleration component implemented by CUDA is 6.5-times faster than its CPU counterpart. </p><p data-anchor-id="corn">Cui and Feng (2013, 2014) proposed GPU-based accurate FFD of polygonal objects, the results of which are represented in terms of trimmed tensor product Bézier patches or triangular Bézier patches. They are sufficiently efficient to meet the real-time or interactive demands of large-scale models. However, the deformation is only performed on the linear geometry, without considering the normal of the model. Smooth FFD (Cui and Feng 2015 ) is proposed by Cui and Feng (2015), which adjust the deformed the results of above work according to the normal information of the model so that to obtain a smooth free-form deformation with visually plausible smooth geometry and shading. However, Smooth FFD will generate degenerative triangles and narrow triangle which will do damage accuracy and efficiency in many areas such as CAD, PDE-based computation and so on. And when it comes to generality, Smooth FFD is implemented by CUDA which will limit their whole framework to NVIDIA hardware. <br>
Therefore, we propose a method which is based Smooth FFD to address the above problems.</p><ol data-anchor-id="ppbu">

In Smooth FFD, each triangle and its normal field are deformed as two cubic triangular Bézier patches which are generated via constrained fitting method whose input are the sample points  sampled from B-Spline body. Then, the curved geometry corresponding to the deformed triangles is locally adjusted to tone the smoothness of the geometry appearance according to the deformed normal field. As a result, a smooth free-form deformation with visually plausible smooth geometry and shading is obtained.</p><div class="md-section-divider"></div><h2 data-anchor-id="22wr" id="三角形分割">三角形分割</h2><p data-anchor-id="96l3">According to Feng et al. (1998), Feng and Peng (2000), Accurate FFD as well as Smooth FFD will clip the input model against the knot boxes in order to get accurate result of FFD. However, the final result of Smooth FFD is describe as cubic triangular Bézier patch which is only a  approximation rather than the accurate high-order one. It is a success trade-off between precision and efficiency. Therefore, the limitation that input model should be clipped against the knot boxes can be remove. <br>
Thus, the weekness introduced by bad quality triangle can also be conquered if we ask for a method which can clip mothod to triangle as regular as possible. On the other side, for two triangle which have common edge, the clipping scheme should be the same to avoid grap cracks. <br>
So our clipping algorithm should receive a triangle and a factor <code>c</code> represent the sub-triangle approximate side, and output the clipping scheme in which the sub-triangles' area is as similarly to each other as possible while the quality of each sub-triangle should as good as possible. Main procedures of this algorithm is as follows:</p><ol data-anchor-id="jo2q">
<li>compute the clipping points in triangle edge which divide edge into <code>ceiling(edge_length / c)</code> segments evenly.</li>
<li>recursively clip triangle.</li>
<li>use cvt to optimize the position of inner vertexes of the sub-triangles.</li>
</ol><p data-anchor-id="gutf">The above algorithm have good result, but it's to complex to be implemented in OpenGL Compute Shader. Further more, there are a lot of repeated calculation for the model repsented by many triangles which have the Similar size. <br>
Hence, we first compute all possible cases of the clipping of triangles, and restore the result in a table. When we really clip a triangle, we can get a pattern from the table according the size of the triangle and the factor <code>c</code>. We trade space for time and the cost of space is resonable.</p><ol data-anchor-id="55oo">
